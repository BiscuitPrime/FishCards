## The repository for the game Project Nemo

You can find the game here : https://biscuitprime.itch.io/project-nemo

While the game itself isn't much, I am quite happy with the architecture, as it allows for some modularity and easy expansion of the game overall. However, events caused some issues since I lacked the foresight to pre-plan their use, leading to parallel calls and issues.
